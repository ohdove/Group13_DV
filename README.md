## Project Overview  
This dashboard was developed as part of our Data Visualisation group project. It provides **interactive visualisations** to explore drug and alcohol testing trends in Australia, focusing on:  
- Comparing test outcomes across different age groups  
- Understanding trends in fines, arrests, and charges  
- Exploring regional differences in enforcement  
- Identifying areas with higher positive test counts using interactive maps  

The goal is to make **complex road safety data easier to understand** for the public, law enforcement, and policymakers.

## Finalized and Selected Datasets  
We used **3 raw datasets**:  
- `police_enforcement_2024_alcohol_drug_tests`  
- `police_enforcement_2024_positive_breath_tests`  
- `police_enforcement_2024_positive_drug_tests`  

These datasets were cleaned and aggregated to create **final datasets used for visualisations**:  
- `BarChart_PositiveCountbyTestType.csv`  
- `LineChart_FinesChargesArrests_byAgeGroup_2024_alcohol.csv`  
- `LineChart_FinesChargesArrests_byAgeGroup_2024_drug.csv`  
- `Sunburst_FinesArrestsCharges_byJurisdictionTestType_2024.csv`  
- `Map_TotalPositiveTestCount_byArea.csv`  

## GenAI Usage Statements  
GenAI tools were used to support various aspects of the project, including:  
- **Data processing:** Guidance on merging and cleaning datasets to prepare them for visualization  
- **Code development:** Debugging JavaScript and D3.js code, especially for implementing complex chart types  
- **Website development:** Assistance with integrating interactive charts and maps, and troubleshooting layout issues

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – for website structure, styling, and interactivity  
- **D3.js** – for creating interactive visualisations  
- **Google Fonts** – for typography  
- **Custom-designed UI components** – for an engaging and consistent user interface

## Project Vision  
We aim to create **informative, interactive, and user-friendly visualisations** that allow:  
- Public users to explore trends and gain awareness about road safety  
- Law enforcement to monitor offenses and allocate resources effectively  
- Policymakers to analyze trends and make evidence-based decisions  

Our design prioritizes **clarity, accessibility, and interactivity**, enabling users to quickly interpret complex patterns in drug and alcohol testing data.
